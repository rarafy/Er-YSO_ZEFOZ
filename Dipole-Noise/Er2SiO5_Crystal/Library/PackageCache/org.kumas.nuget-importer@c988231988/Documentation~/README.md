 "NuGet importer for Unity" is a fast, easy-to-use, and powerful editor extension that provides you to import NuGet packages into Unity.
This package also fully supports native plugins.
(This was inspired by [GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity), but made from scratch.)

## Usage

### Menu item

![Menu item](images/MenuItem.png)

- Manage packages ・・・ Open the main window for managing packages.
- Repair packages ・・・ Optimize the dependencies of installed packages and repair them.
- Delete cache ・・・ Delete the cache. (However, the cache is deleted every time the assembly is loaded.)
- NuGet importer settings ・・・ Open the window for configuring settings with NuGet importer.
- Check update ・・・ Check for updates.
- Go to the project page ・・・ Open the "NuGet importer for Unity" web page.

### Main window

![Main window](images/MainWindow.png)

1. Mode to search from NuGet.
1. Mode to search from the installed packages.
1. Include the development version or not.
1. Input area for search words. (Incremental search.)
1. Search results.
1. Package details.
1. Version selection.
1. Operations on the package.


### NuGet importer settings

![NuGet importer settings](images/Settings.png)

1. Specify the installation location. （We recommend using UPM.)
1. Specify the method for determining the package version when solving dependency. (We recommend setting Suit.)
1. Specifies whether check the package is installed at startup. If the package directory exists, NuGet-importer-for-Unity determines as the package is already installed in the project. If NuGet-importer-for-Unity finds missing packages, automatically install them. ( We recommend turning it on.)
1. The maximum number of search results to cache. (0 or less is not cached.)
1. The maximum number of catalogs to cache. (0 or less is not cached.)
1. The maximum number of icons to cache. (0 or less is not cached.)
1. Reduce the amount of data in the communication or not. If on, images of packages not installed in the project will not fetch, and NuGet-importer-for-Unity will not perform package searches until the input has settled.
1. The maximum number of retry attempts to get data when data fetch fails.
1. Time out seconds of communication.

## Configure of .gitignore

You may want to keep installed packages out of git's tracking. In that case, you can add the following to  `.gitignore`. NuGet-importer-for-Unity manages the list of installed packages in `Asset/package.config`, and you can restore packages by sharing this file.
```bash
# NuGet importer
/[Aa]ssets/[Pp]ackages.meta
/[Aa]ssets/[Pp]ackages/

/[Nn]u[Gg]et/

/[Pp]ackages/*/
!/[Pp]ackages/your embedded package to share with git/
```

## Note

NuGet-importer-for-Unity install files not required at runtime (e.g., rulesets, documentation, etc.) are installed to `(your project)/NuGet`. If you want to reference them, add them reference manually.

When importing this package into your project, this package makes the following changes.
- Turn off `PlayerSettings -> assemblyVersionValidation`. (To make Unity not check the assembly version as NuGet does.)
- Add reference `System.IO.Compression.FileSystem.dll`. (NuGet importer for Unity handles Zip files.)
